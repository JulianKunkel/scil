The compressed buffer consists of a header:
byte CHAIN_LENGTH // the number of compressors to apply.

Then for the first compressor to apply the format looks like:
byte magic_number // The compressor number as registered in SCIL.
byte * COMPRESSOR_SPECIFIC_HEADER
byte * COMPRESSED DATA

If the chain consists of multiple compressors the final format looks like:

byte CHAIN_LENGTH
byte magic_number_ALGO1
ALGO1 specific header
